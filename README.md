# Regex_FSM

## Overview

`regex_fsm.py` is a Python implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) that processes regular expressions and validates strings against them. It supports a subset of regular expression syntax and provides functionality to visualize the FSM as a DOT file for graph representation.

## Features

- **Regex Parsing**: Converts a regular expression into a finite state machine.
- **String Validation**: Checks if a given string matches the regular expression.
- **DOT File Export**: Generates a DOT file representation of the FSM for visualization.
- **Supported Regex Tokens**:
  - `.`: Matches any single character.
  - `[abc]`: Matches any character within the brackets.
  - `[^abc]`: Matches any character not within the brackets.
  - `[a-z]`: Matches a range of characters.
  - `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding token.
  - `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token.
  - `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding token.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize the FSM
Create an instance of the `RegexFSM` class by passing a regular expression as a string:
```python
from regex_fsm import RegexFSM

fsm = RegexFSM("[a-z]+")
```

### 2. Validate Strings
Use the `check_string` method to validate if a string matches the regular expression:
```python
result = fsm.check_string("hello")  # Returns True
result = fsm.check_string("123")    # Returns False
```

### 3. Export to DOT File
Generate a DOT file representation of the FSM for visualization:
```python
dot_representation = fsm.to_dot_file()
with open("fsm.dot", "w") as file:
    file.write(dot_representation)
```
You can use tools like Graphviz to visualize the FSM from the DOT file.

## Example
```python
from regex_fsm import RegexFSM

# Create FSM for the regex pattern
fsm = RegexFSM("a*b")

# Validate strings
print(fsm.check_string("aaab"))  # True
print(fsm.check_string("b"))     # True
print(fsm.check_string("c"))     # False

# Export FSM to DOT file
with open("fsm.dot", "w") as file:
    file.write(fsm.to_dot_file())
```

## Notes
- The implementation focuses on a subset of regex features and may not support advanced patterns.
- Ensure the input regex pattern is valid and adheres to the supported syntax.

## Visualization
The DOT file generated by the `to_dot_file` method can be visualized using Graphviz or similar tools to understand the FSM structure.
